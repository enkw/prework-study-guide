## Prework Study Guide for students of the NW Bootcamp

This application serves as notes and study material for what is gone over in the NorthWestern Coding Bootcamp. As of now HTML, CSS, GIT, JavaScript, and some additioanl miscellaneous sections can be found. Created with minimal prior knowledge to this process, most of the creation of this application was a learning experience that I am excited to expand upon in the future.
